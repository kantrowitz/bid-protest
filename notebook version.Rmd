```{r}

# setwd("~/ShaunSo/Bid Protests/Sunlight code")
library(jsonlite)
library(rlist)
URL <- "https://fedapi.io:443/api/catalog/gao/procurement/bidprotestdecisions/record/search?q=*&size=4132"
test <- fromJSON(URL)
test <- test$record
list.save(test, "datadumpmaster.rds")
ids <- test$id
write.csv(ids, "ids.csv")
ids <- data.frame(ids) #important, later
meta <- test$meta
```
Next step: simplifying the data and making it useable.


```{r}
library(dplyr) # yeah, baby, some piping action coming up at the end (magrittr). Also, select and mutate.
newtest <- select(test, -id)
write.csv(meta, "meta.csv")
meta <- select(meta, timestamp:source)
meta <- select(meta, -classification)
meta <- bind_cols(meta, ids) #join ids back in 
meta <- meta[, c(4,3,2,1)] # reorder the columns for fun
```
Broke each sublist into its own variable for speed and ease. A bit kludgey, but there weren't that many.

```{r}
record <- test$record
record_id <- record$id #duplicate of IDs, don't really need this
matterof <- record$matterof
file <- record$file
date <- record$date
decision_pdf <- record$decision_pdf
summaryrecord <- record$summary
agencies <- record$agencies_mentioned
decision <- record$decision
contacts <- record$contacts
names(decision) <- c("Summary", "Verdict", "Long")

```
Make something we can use right now:

```{r}
decision_pdf <- data.frame(decision_pdf)
long <- decision$Long
decision <- select(decision, -3)
usable_now <- bind_cols(meta, decision_pdf)
usable_now <- bind_cols(usable_now, decision) #accelerate the coolness
usable_now$ids <- as.character(usable_now$ids) #convert to strings if not fixed above already.
usable_now$decision_pdf <- as.character(usable_now$decision_pdf) #same
write.csv(usable_now, "usethis1.csv")
usable_now <- bind_cols(usable_now, decision) 

```
Get fancy with agencies and other info.

and http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/Convert-quot-ragged-quot-list-to-matrix-td895283.html
```{r}
 agencyNames <- lapply(1:4132, function(x) x <- agencies[[x]]$Name)
 agencyIDs <- lapply(1:4132, function(x) x <- agencies[[x]]$Id)
 agencyURIs <- lapply(1:4132, function(x) x <- agencies[[x]]$URI)
```
Note: you can't use something like: 

agencies_test <- do.call(rbind.data.frame, agencies) 

because it takes the two numbers in row three (for example) and separates them, instead of combining them into one cell. It does this wherever it encounters data separated by a comma.

The following works to change the list of files(each entry of which sometimes had multiple files in it) into a dataframe, with each list as an observation in list form. Good! (not this immediate next fragment, though!)

```{r}
usable_now <- bind_cols(usable_now, decision) 
file_list <- data.frame(t(sapply(file,c))) # the transpose is necessary, this way. ???

```

Add on the original date to the usable file.

```{r}
colnames(usable_now) <- c("Ids", "Source", "TimeStampIso8601", "TimeStamp", "Decision_PDF", "Summary", "Verdict", "duh", "duh1", "duh2", "duh3") # Yes, this is stupid. It's a quick fix for now.
usable_now <- select(usable_now, 1:7)
original_date <- date$original_text
new_usable <- mutate(usable_now, original_date=original_date)

```

Convert the empty records to a NA. This is trickier than it looks, and necessary. We don't want to lose the empty records because we want to create a matrix and not have ragged lists.

```{r}
listy <- sapply(file_list, function(f){is.na(f)<-which(f == '');f}) #R magic
testy <- lapply(listy, function(x) {x[length(x)==0] <- c("NA"); x}) # ditch the empties. YA!! Too bad it takes two steps
```
Remove the extra objects that are unnecessary at this point:

```{r}
rm(URL, record_id, record, date,decision, decision_pdf, ids, meta, newtest, listy, testy)
```
This tests to see which entries are blank in the list of agencyIDs.
```{r}
cool <- lapply(1:4132, function(x) x <- is.integer(agencyIDs[[x]]) && length(agencyIDs[[x]] ==0L))
cool <- unlist(cool) # No reason it should be a list. It then becomes a logical vector.
4132 - sum(cool) # 4. It's not worth screwing around with this.
cool <- !cool # because it's so not cool.
these <- which(cool == TRUE) # a vector of indices of the records we need to fix, i.e. 3,4, 2449 and 2450. Because there's only 4 of them in this one... See below in the white for a faster (still not great) way around some of this.
```

Save this scrap of code: which(x %in% c(2,4)) will provide multiple matching on a long vector.

Also, use stringr library (Hadleyverse):

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/stringr.pdf , p6
str_c -->> join multiple strings into a single string
str_replace_na -->> converts NA to "NA"

```{r}
library(stringr)
#  This worked to concat: 
agencyIDs[these] <- str_c(agencyIDs[these], sep=" ", collapse=NULL)
# It's a little messy, but I'm keeping it.
agencyNames[these] <- str_c(agencyNames[these], sep=" ", collapse=NULL)
agencyURIs[these] <- str_c(agencyURIs[these], sep=" ", collapse=NULL)
agencyIDs <- unlist(agencyIDs)
agencyNames <- unlist(agencyNames)
agencyURIs <- unlist(agencyURIs)

usable_now <- mutate(usable_now, AgencyID = agencyIDs) # should be piped
usable_now <- mutate(usable_now, agencyName = agencyNames)
usable_now <- mutate(usable_now, agencyURI = agencyURIs)
```

Do the same thing for agencyNames and agencyURIs?
cool <- lapply(1:length(agencyNames), function(x) x <- which(!(agencyNames[x] %in% c("unknown")) ) && length(agencyIDs[[x]] ==0L)) # Gives logical vector this way, in one step.
these <- which(cool == TRUE)

```{r}

#Some more clean up

rm(agencyIDs,agencyNames,agencyURIs, cool)

```
Moving ever onward, to the "Matter Of" -- similar issue, much bigger, though. Getting to the meat of everything, now. Trick here is that some of the list items are missing, i.e., chr(0), and some have 1:3 parts. 

Remove the extra characters from each one using regex?

```{r}

matterof <- gsub("c(\"", "", matterof, fixed=TRUE) %>% #PIPES!!
            gsub("\", \"", ", ", ., fixed=TRUE) %>%
            gsub("\")", "", ., fixed=TRUE)

usable_now <- mutate(usable_now, MatterOf = matterof)

```

Moving on to SummaryRecord. Should make a function to handle this, but I'm cranking through and testing on the fly - each new type of record is different, it seems.


```{r}
# For Summary Record

summaryrecord <- str_c(summaryrecord, sep=" ", collapse=NULL)
summaryrecord <-   gsub("c(\"", "", summaryrecord, fixed=TRUE) %>%
                   gsub("\", \"", ", ", ., fixed=TRUE) %>%
                   gsub("\")", "", ., fixed=TRUE)

usable_now <- mutate(usable_now, SummaryRecord = summaryrecord)

rm(new_usable, test, matterof) # Clean environment. Don't ditch summaryrecord yet. Will need it later.

```

Now, we add the long, multipage description of the case. Note: the file that results is too big for Excel or .csv to really handle. Process this stuff here, NOT in Excel.
```{r}
# For Full Length Record ("Long")

# long <- lapply(1:length(long), function(x) x <- str_c(long[x], sep=" ", collapse=NULL))
# long <- unlist(long)

write.csv(long, "long.csv") # this is a huge long pain in the ass. Too big for Excel and .csv to really handle. Process this stuff here, NOT in Excel.
```

"long" is a character array, even if it's a huge one. Regex in a vector op should do it. 

```{r}
# a general cleanup DON'T USE THIS UNLESS YOU WANT TO START ALL OVER

rm(list = ls())

```
Side notes: It's not worth trying to extract the agencies here, although it could be done. For a long list, yes. Used Excel for most of it, (combinations extractable for automating in the future) and corrected by hand.


```{r}
# Add original_date?? Why not.. Get it outta here..

usable_now <- mutate(usable_now, Original_Date = original_date)

rm(original_date, these)
```

Here's the workhorse function for cleaning the long 'un, in place!!

```{r}
clean_it <- function(longversion) {
                               gsub("c(\"", "", longversion, fixed=TRUE) %>%   
                                gsub("\", \"", " :: ", ., fixed=TRUE) %>%
                                gsub("RELEASE", "RELEASE: ", ., fixed=TRUE)  %>%
                                gsub("\", \n\"", " :: ", ., fixed=TRUE)  %>%
                                gsub("â<U+0080><U+0099>", "'", ., fixed=TRUE)  %>%
                                gsub("OÂ<U+0092>", "'", ., fixed=TRUE)  %>%
                                gsub("Â<U+0092>", "'", ., fixed=TRUE)   %>%
                                gsub("Â<U+0094> x", "", ., fixed=TRUE)  %>%
                                gsub("Â<U+0094>", "", ., fixed=TRUE)  %>%
                                gsub("Â<U+0093>", "", ., fixed=TRUE)  %>%
                                gsub("\"D", "D", ., fixed=TRUE)  %>%
                                gsub(":Â ", ": ", ., fixed=TRUE)  %>%
                                gsub("\\n\\t\\t\\t", "", ., fixed=TRUE)  %>%
                                gsub("\\n\\t\\t", "", ., fixed=TRUE)  %>%
                                gsub("â\u0080\u0099", "'", ., fixed=TRUE) %>%
                                gsub("â\u0080\u0091", "-", ., fixed=TRUE)  %>%
                                gsub("â<U+0080><U+0091>", "-", ., fixed=TRUE)
}      


```

Thoughts on how to handle:
hmm <- long[1:3] # created for testing 

Looks like this one works.

```{r}
# hmm <- long[1:3] # created for testing 
wow <- clean_it(long)

```

write this to a file for safe-keeping, if not already done.

```{r}
write.csv(wow, "long_cleaned.csv", sep=" ", na="NA", row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE)
```

Get the amounts.

```{r}
dollar_amounts <- str_extract_all(long, "\\$.{14}") # library(stringr), thank you Hadley!!!!
# also works with library(gsubfn), then strapply(long, "\\$.{15}", I) and


```

Deal with the dollar_amounts

```{r}
cool <- sapply(1:length(dollar_amounts), function(x) x <- is.character(dollar_amounts[[x]]) && length(dollar_amounts[[x]] ==0L))
these <- which(cool == TRUE) # the vector containing the dollar_amounts
dollar_amounts[these] <- str_c(dollar_amounts[these], sep=",", collapse=NULL) # to join them

lil_clean <- function(longversion) {
                                gsub("c(\"", "", longversion, fixed=TRUE) %>%   
                                gsub("\\\\", "", .) %>%  
                                gsub("\"", "", .) 
}

dollar_amounts <- lil_clean((dollar_amounts))
```

Write it out.

```{r}

usable_now <- mutate(usable_now, Dollar_Amounts = dollar_amounts)
write.csv(usable_now, "with_dollar_amounts.csv")

```

Get the RFQ #s.

numbers <- regmatches(summaryrecord, gregexpr("(?=(\\(RFP|\\(TORFP|\\(RFTOP|\\(RFQ|\\(TOR)).*?(?=(\\,|for|issued|\\(f|\\.\\sTh|\\st))", summaryrecord, perl=TRUE))

OR

numbers <- regmatches(summaryrecord, gregexpr("(?=(No\\.|Nos\\.)).*?(?=(\\,|for|issued|\\(f|\\.\\sTh|\\st))", summaryrecord, perl=TRUE))

Regex for days.
```{r}
numbers <- regmatches(summaryrecord, gregexpr("(?=(\\(RFP|\\(TORFP|\\(RFTOP|\\(RFQ|\\(TOR)).*?(?=(\\,|for|issued|\\(f|\\.\\sTh|\\st))", summaryrecord, perl=TRUE))
numbers <- gsub("char\\(0\\)", "N\\A", numbers)
usable_now <- mutate(usable_now, RFQ_Num = numbers)
write.csv(usable_now, "with_dollar_and_RFQs.csv")
```
